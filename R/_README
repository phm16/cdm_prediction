These scripts are required to generate the training and test sets:

_setup.R:  loads packages
read.R:  reads training data csv files
features.R:  generates features for modeling
model_df.R:  generate and select features to be used in modeling
model_ctrl.R:  model training control and resampling strategy
models.R:  models used on full training data
models_station.R:  models split by station A123, A456, B456
models_ensemble.R:  ensemble models
phm_dashboard:  Shiny dashboard for predicting removal rate


These scripts are used for exploring the data at various stages of the modeling process:

explore.R:  primarily used for exploring data in the original format
explore_features.R:  explore post-feature generation
explore_model.R:  explore post-data split

The data folders should be structured like this:

data/CMP_training_removalrate.csv
data/training/CMP_training-000.csv
... all other files
data/training/CMP_training-184.csv
