These scripts are required to generate the training and test sets:

_setup.R:  loads packages
read.R:  reads training data csv files
features.R:  generates features for modeling
model_df.R:  select features to be used in modeling
data_split.R:  splits 70% of the oldest wafer/stage to training; 30% of the newest wafer/stage to test

These scripts are used for exploring the data at various stages of the modeling process:

explore.R:  primarily used for exploring data in the original format
explore_features.R:  explore post-feature generation
explore_model.R:  explore post-data split

The data folder should be structured like this:

data/CMP_training_removalrate.csv
data/training/CMP_training-000.csv
... all other files
data/training/CMP_training-184.csv
