AVG_REMOVAL_RATE
AVG_REMOVAL_RATE_OUTLIER_FLAG:  1 if AVG_REMOVAL_RATE > 2000
MULTIPLE_STAGE_FLAG:  1 if wafer goes through STAGE A and B
TOTAL_PROCESSING_DURATION:  max timestamp - min timestamp for each wafer
A_1:  time in stage A chamber 1
A_2:  time in stage A chamber 2...

B_5
B_6: time in stage B chamber 6
SEQUENCE:  if wafer is present in each of the stage / chamber combos above it is coded as a 1 else 0 (i.e. S000000111 means the wafer went through STAGE B and chambers 4, 5, and 6)
TOTAL_POLISHING_DURATION: sum of A_1 thru B_6
PRCT_TIME_POLISHING:  TOTAL_POLISHING_DURATION / TOTAL_PROCESSING_DURATION
